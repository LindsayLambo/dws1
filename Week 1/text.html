Giant squid can grow to a <br />tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates<br /> put the maximum size at <strong>13 m (43 ft)</strong> for females and <strong>10 m <br />(33 ft)</strong> for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two <br />long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated<br /> <strong>14 m (46 ft)</strong>, one of the largest living organisms). The mantle <br />is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), <br />and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m<br /> (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring <strong>20 m (66 ft)</strong> or more<br /> have not been scientifically documented.			On 30 September<br /> 2004, researchers from the <acronym title="NMNS"<(Museum of Nature and Science)></acronym> of Tokyo, Japan and the <acronym title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</acronym><br />(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the first <br />images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of <br />the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS <br />and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the <br />first time on 4 December 2006.			</p>		</div>		</body></html>
