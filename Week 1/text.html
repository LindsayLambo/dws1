Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism):<br /> recent estimates put the maximum size at <strong>13 m (43 ft)</strong> for females<br /> and <strong>10 m (33 ft)</strong> for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two<br /> long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated <strong>14 m (46 ft)</strong>,<br /> one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long<br /> (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles<br /> is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring <strong>20 m (66 ft)</strong> or more<br /> have not been scientifically documented.			On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <p><acronym title="NMNS"<(Museum of Nature and Science)></acronym><br /> of Tokyo, Japan and the OWA (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the first images of a live giant <br />squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were <br />released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.			</p>		</div>		</body></html>
