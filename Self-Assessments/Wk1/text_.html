		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

		<p>The <dfn>giant squid</dfn> (genus: Architeuthis) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates put the maximum size at <strong>13 m (43 ft)</strong> for females and <strong>10 m (33 ft)</strong> for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated <strong>14 m (46 ft)</strong>, one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about <strong>2 m (6.6 ft) long</strong> (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). <em>Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</em></p>

		<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> (Museum of Nature and Science) of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association) took the <em>first</em> images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
