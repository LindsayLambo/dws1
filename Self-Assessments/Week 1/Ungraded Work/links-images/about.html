				<p>Hello, there! We are an organization that helps explore the many fun family events, festivals, parties, bands, 		and much more, so you don't have to! Well isn't that nice of us? We try to make sure we pick out the best, worst, 		and just strange events that are happening all around us, all the time, so we can help promote all our friends and 		associates who put all these events together and perform in the bands, as well as the artwork, crafts, and way		too much to list that goes into these get-togethers of all sorts.  Thanks for checking us out and keep up with us to 		see what is going on in your area! Come on out and support everyone and have a great time with us! Contact us if you		need anything or just have questions! Thank you, peace, and love to all! Bless you!</p>			<ul>				<li><a href="links.html">Home</a></li>		</ul>					</body></html>
